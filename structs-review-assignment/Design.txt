Program Name: CS162 Structs review assignment

Program Description:  write an app to maintain a list of activities that the user likes to participate in. The app should load all activity information from a data file (activities.txt) once the app is started. It allows the user to view, add, remove, and search for activities. The app should save the data back to the same data file when the program exits.
In this assignment we need to create and submit a zip file, activities.zip with the following files 
activity.h
activity.cpp
main.h
main.cpp
activities.txt
algorithm.pdf

Design:
A. INPUT
Define the input variables including name data type. 

B. OUTPUT
Define the output variables including data types. 

C. CALCULATIONS
 no calculations needed


D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs. 

creat a zip file:
activity.h
activity.cpp
main.h
